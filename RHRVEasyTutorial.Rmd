RHRVEasy automates all steps of a Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis, including data processing, indices calculation, and statistical analysis. It takes as input a list of folders, each containing the recordings of a same population. It calculates time, frequency, and nonlinear domain HRV indices, and then it applies hypothesis test, and corrects the significance levels. If there are more than two experimental groups and statistically significant differences are found, it performs a post hoc analysis to find out which groups have the differences. 

# 0. Set up required to run this tutorial
This tutorial uses the recordings of the [Normal Sinus Rhythm RR Interval Database](https://physionet.org/content/nsr2db/1.0.0/) (hereinafter referred to as NSR_DB) and of the [Congestive Heart Failure RR Interval Database](https://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/database/chf2db/) (hereinafter referred to as CHF_DB). The first is made of healthy subjects, and the second of patients with a severe cardiac pathology. Hence significant differences in many HRV indices are expected between them.

To ilustrate how to work with more than two experimental groups, half of the recordings from both databases were randomly selected. The NSR_HALF_DB database is made up of 24 recordings randomly chosen from the 58 of the NSR database. The CHF_HALF_DB database is made up of 14 recordings chosen from the 28 of the CHF database. The four databases are available in the [RHRVEasy GitHub repository](https://github.com/sofiabardaji/RHRVEasy). To run this tutorial, the following four variables must contain the folder of the local machine where the files of each of these databases are:
```{r}
#@TODO REPLACE_WITH_LOCAL_PATH
base_path = "rrs/" # "C:\\rrs\\RHRVEasy\\rrs"
NSR_DB = file.path(base_path, "normal")
CHF_DB = file.path(base_path, "chf")
NSR_HALF_DB = file.path(base_path, "normal_half")
CHF_HALF_DB = file.path(base_path, "chf_half")
```

RHRVEasy permits creating an Excel spreadsheet with all the HRV indices calculated for each recording. The following variable must contain the folder on the local machine where the Excel spreadsheet is to be saved:
```{r}
spreadsheet_path = base_path
```

# 1. Time and frequency analysis

RHRVEasy enables the user to carry out a full HRV analysis by just invoking a function with a single mandatory parameter: a list with the folders containing the recordings of the experimental groups. This list must have at least two folders. Each folder must contain all the RR recordings of the same experimental group and no additional files, as RHRVEasy will try to open all the files in those folders. The name that will be used to refer to each experimental group within RHRVEasy will be the name of the folder in which its recordings are located.

The following function call computes the time and frequency indices for the NSR_DB and CHF_DB databases, and and performs a statistical comparison of each index correcting the significance level with the Bonferroni method:

```{r}
library("RHRVEasy")
RHRVEasy_obj = RHRVEasy(folders = c(NSR_DB, CHF_DB))
```

When the returned object is displayed in the console, it shows which indices present statistically significant differences:

```{r}
#@TODO coreegir Posición del ";"
RHRVEasy_obj
```
All computed indices, as well as all pvalues resulting from all comparisons, are stored in dataframes contained in the object. Two different sets of pvalues are available; the ones obtained before (`pValues`) and after (`uncorrectedPvalues`) applying the significance level correction:

```{r}
head(RHRVEasy_obj$TimeAnalysis)
head(RHRVEasy_obj$FrequencyAnalysis)
#Non-linear indices are set up NA since they have not been calculated
#@TODO ¿Corregir esto?
head(RHRVEasy_obj$pValues)
head(RHRVEasy_obj$uncorrectedPvalues)
```

The `format` parameter specifies the format in which the RR intervals are stored. All formats supported by the RHRV package can be used: `WFDB`, `ASCII`, `RR`, `Polar`, `Suunto`, `EDFPlus` or `Ambit` (check the [RHRV website](https://rhrv.r-forge.r-project.org/) for more information). The default format is RR, where the beat distances in seconds are stored in a single column of an ASCII file. This is the format of the four databases used in this tutorial.


By default, the frequency analysis is performed using the Fourier transform. It is also possible to use the Wavelet transform pasing the value `'wavelet'` to the `typeAnalysis` parameter (check the paper "García, C. A., Otero, A., Vila, X., & Márquez, D. G. (2013). A new algorithm for wavelet-based heart rate variability analysis. Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 8(6), 542-550" for details):
```{r}
RHRVEasy_obj_wavelet = RHRVEasy(folders =c(NSR_DB, CHF_DB),  typeAnalysis = 'wavelet', n_jobs = 1)
RHRVEasy_obj_wavelet
```

# 2. Correction of the significance level

Given that multiple statistical tests are performed on several HRV indices, a correction of the significance level should be applied. The Bonferroni method is used by default (@TODO ¿usar fdr?). This behavior can be overridden with the parameter `correctionMethod`. The possible values of this parameter besides `bonferroni` are `holm`, `hochberg`, `hommel`, `BH` (Benjamini & Hochberg), `fdr` (false discovery rate), `BY` (Benjamini & Yekutieli), and `none`. The boolean parameter `correction` can also be used to indicate that no correction is to be made; if the value of this parameter is TRUE be the Bonferroni method will be used.

```{r}
RHRVEasy_obj_no_correction = RHRVEasy(folders = c(NSR_DB, CHF_DB), correction = FALSE)
RHRVEasy_obj_fdr = RHRVEasy(folders = c(NSR_DB, CHF_DB), correctionMethod = 'fdr')
#Let us compare the pvalues obtained with different correction methods 
head(cbind(RHRVEasy_obj_no_correction$pValues, RHRVEasy_obj_fdr$pValues, RHRVEasy_obj$pValues))
```

The significance level can be changed with the parameter `significance_level` (the default value is 0.05):

```{r}
RHRVEasy_obj_001 = RHRVEasy(folders = c(NSR_DB, CHF_DB), significance_level = 0.01)
#When we lower the significance level from 0.05 to 0.01 there are no longer significant differences in the SDNNIDX temporal index
RHRVEasy_obj_001
```

# 3. Saving the indices to an Excel spreadsheet

If the argument `saveHRVindexesInPath` is specified when invoking the function `RHRVEasy`, an Excel spreadsheet with all the HRV indices calculated for each recording will be created in the path specified specified in this parameter. The name of the spreadsheet generated is "<group 1 name> vs <group 2 name> .xlsx":

```{r}
RHRVEasy_obj = RHRVEasy(folders =c(NSR_DB, CHF_DB), saveHRVindexesInPath = spreadsheet_path)
```

This spreadsheet can also be generated from the object returned by `RHRVEasy` by calling the function `saveHRVindexes`.

```{r}
saveHRVindexes (RHRVEasy_obj, saveHRVindexesInPath = spreadsheet_path)
```

# 4. Comparing more than two experimental groups

If the analysis involves three or more groups, when statistically significant differences are found among them it does not necessarily mean that there are statistically significant differences between all pairs of groups. In such a scenario the Dunn post-hoc is used to find which pairs of groups present differences:

```{r}
#Comparison of the four databases
RHRVEasy_obj_four_groups = RHRVEasy(folders =c(NSR_DB, CHF_DB, NSR_HALF_DB, CHF_HALF_DB))
RHRVEasy_obj_four_groups
#Let us save the indices
#@TODO LF Aparece como significativo en DUNN Pero no en ANOVA!!!!
saveHRVindexes (RHRVEasy_obj_four_groups, saveHRVindexesInPath = spreadsheet_path)
```


# 5. Overwriting default parameters

Any parameter of any RHRV function can be specified as an additional parameter of the `RHRVEasy` function; in this case, the default value used for that parameter will be overwritten by the one specified for the user. Tthe default values used in the RHRVEasy package are the same as those used in the RHRV package. For more information about the parameters available you can consult the [RHRV website](https://rhrv.r-forge.r-project.org/). For example, the following analysis modifies the the limits of the ULF, VLF, LF and HF spectral bands, and uses an interpolation frequency (`freqhr`) of 2 Hz:

```{r}
RHRVEasy_overwrite_parameters = RHRVEasy(folders =c(NSR_DB, CHF_DB),
                        freqhr = 2, ULFmin = 0, ULFmax = 0.02, VLFmin = 0.02, VLFmax = 0.07,  LFmin = 0.07, LFmax = 0.20, HFmin = 0.20, HFmax = 0.5 )

RHRVEasy_overwrite_parameters
```

# 6. Nonlinear analysis

The calculation of the nonlinear indices requires considerable computational resources. Whereas in a typical HRV analysis the computation of all the time and frequency domain indices for a few dozens of recordings often completes within a few minutes, the computation of the nonlinear indices could last many hours. By default the boolean parameter `nonLinear` is set to `FALSE`; only if this parameter is set to `TRUE` the nonlinear analysis is performed. Otherwise, only time and frequency indices will be calculated.

**Warning**: the following sentence, commented in the tutorial, will take several hours to execute on a medium to high performance PC, and possibly several days on a low performance PC.

```{r}
# #@TODO Borrar Código de depuración con los tiempos de ejecución
# RHRVEasy_obj_nonLinear = RHRVEasy(folders =c(NSR_DB, CHF_DB), nonLinear = TRUE)
# RHRVEasy_obj_nonLinear
# head(RHRVEasy_obj_nonLinear$NonLinearAnalysis)
# #Let us save the indices
# saveHRVindexes (RHRVEasy_obj_nonLinear, saveHRVindexesInPath = spreadsheet_path)
```
